# OSDevAsm
A little bit of OSdev for x86 and amd64 in asm.


Forked from narke in April 2021.


## One to one comparision of NASM and FASM

src/amd64/ builds a small OS barebone with NASM
src/amd64-fasm builds the same with Fasm flat assembler


NASM

  + more mainstream, examples in osdev.org are NASM

  + can make a listing of produced assembly ( nasm -l ... )

  + 11 screens full of contents, 285 pages pdf documentation


Fasm

  + less to type in source code ( IMHO more pleasant syntax )

  + superfast compilation

  + 1.5 srceens of contents
